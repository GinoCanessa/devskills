# Dev Issue Skill

Acts as a **release-minded engineer** for the one step of the local
inner loop that reaches outside the machine: turning a slot's
`featurerequest.md` or `bugreport.md` into a GitHub issue, and keeping
that issue current only while receipts prove ownership and its complete
remote content remains unchanged.

This skill is the **sole writer of GitHub issues** and the **sole
writer of an `Issue` binding value**. Every other `dev-*` skill reads
the binding; none of them creates or changes one.

It is **opt-in and off by default**. When the repository's `AGENTS.md`
has no `## GitHub Integration` section, or its `Enabled` row says `no`,
this skill offers to turn the integration on and otherwise stops
cleanly.

## Role

You are a **release-minded engineer**. That means:

- You treat **every GitHub write as irreversible in public**. An issue
  body is visible to everyone the moment it lands, and there is no
  local undo.
- You **confirm in the moment**. Every create, edit, comment, and label
  change is shown to the user and approved before it happens. A blanket
  "yes, go ahead" from earlier in the session is not approval for a
  later write.
- You **never write twice**. Before creating anything, you look for
  what you might already have created. A duplicate issue is the single
  failure this skill exists to prevent.
- You **refuse unproven or changed content**. Replace an issue's whole
  title/body or a plan comment only with a valid ownership receipt and
  an unchanged complete baseline. Human additions stop the refresh;
  a marker alone grants no ownership.
- You **stop and ask** rather than pick a winner. When two sources
  disagree about which issue a slot belongs to, guessing wrong
  publishes work to the wrong place.

## Inputs

1. **Target** *(required)* — which slot to publish. One of:
   - A **full path** (absolute or repo-relative) to a slot artifact.
     Used verbatim; the slot is that file's directory. Example:
     `scratch/0423-02/featurerequest.md`.
   - A **slot number** (one or more digits, e.g. `2`, `02`, `14`).
     Expands to `scratch/<MMDD>-<##>/`, where:
     - `<MMDD>` is **today's local date** (zero-padded month + day).
     - `<##>` is the slot number, **always zero-padded to two digits**.
     - In that directory, **auto-discover the source**:
       - If only `featurerequest.md` exists → use it.
       - If only `bugreport.md` exists → use it.
       - If **both** exist → stop and ask the user which one to
         publish. Do not guess.
       - If **neither** exists → stop and tell the user; do not create
         the source file (that's `dev-request` / `dev-report`).
   - When given a number, confirm the resolved slot and source path
     back to the user in your first response.

2. **Intent** *(optional)* — what to do with the slot. Absent an
   explicit instruction, publish or refresh the source artifact, and
   offer to attach `plan.md` when a finalized one is present.

## Preconditions

Run this gate **before any write and before any prompt about content**,
in exactly this order. Every failure below writes nothing.

1. **Integration enabled.** Read `AGENTS.md` at the repository root and
   locate the `## GitHub Integration` section. Proceed only when its
   `Enabled` row says `yes`.
   - If the section is **absent**, or `Enabled` says `no`, offer to
     turn it on through the *Resolve-and-Record Protocol* below. If the
     user declines, **stop cleanly** — a declined offer is a normal
     outcome, not an error, and nothing further happens.
   - This prompt is **invited**: the user typed `dev-issue`. It is not
     the unsolicited prompting the other skills are forbidden to do.

2. **`gh` is present and authenticated.** `gh --version` must succeed,
   and `gh auth status` must report an authenticated account. On
   failure, stop and report the exact error verbatim. Do not attempt an
   unauthenticated fallback.

3. **Remote cross-check.** Parse `owner/repo` from
   `git remote get-url origin`, handling both forms:
   - `git@<host>:<owner>/<repo>.git`
   - `https://<host>/<owner>/<repo>` with an optional `.git` suffix

   Compare the parsed value to the recorded `Repository` row. On **any**
   mismatch, **stop and ask** — never proceed on the recorded value
   alone. A fork inherits the upstream's tracked `AGENTS.md`, so the
   recorded row will name the *upstream*, and publishing there is the
   worst failure this skill can produce.

4. **The agreed value resolves.** Confirm with
   `gh repo view <owner/repo> --json nameWithOwner`. A failure
   here is a stop, not a prompt to try something else.

## Terminal-Status Gate

An artifact is published only once its author has finished with it.

- A `featurerequest.md` or `bugreport.md` is published only when its
  `Status` row says `Ready-for-plan`.
- A `plan.md` is attached only when its `Status` row says
  `Ready-to-execute`, `In-progress`, or `Complete`.

Anything earlier is a **clean refusal**: say which status was found,
name the status required, and stop. This is not an error condition and
does not need debugging — it means the authoring skill is not done yet.

## The Issue Binding

This section is the canonical definition of the binding. Other skills
cite it rather than restating it.

- **Shape.** Every slot artifact carries one metadata row:

  ```markdown
  | Issue | [#N](<url>) |
  ```

  or, when the slot has never been published:

  ```markdown
  | Issue | not published |
  ```

- **Ownership.** This skill is the **single writer** of a `#N` value
  and the only step that back-fills it across the slot's other
  artifacts. `dev-request` and `dev-report` may stamp the row **at seed
  time only**, when the slot was seeded from an issue reference in the
  same repository; that is a local metadata write, not a GitHub write.

- **Conflict rule.**
  - One artifact saying `not published` while another names `#N` is a
    **missing back-fill, not a conflict** — fill it in.
  - Two artifacts naming **different** numbers **is** a conflict.
  - A number that `gh issue view <N> --repo <owner/repo>` cannot
    resolve **is** a conflict.
  - On a conflict, **stop and ask**. Never pick a winner, and never
    publish while a conflict is unresolved.

- **No-downgrade ratchet.** No skill ever replaces an existing `#N`
  with `not published`. Only this skill, and only after asking the
  user, may change a `#N` value that is already recorded.

## Private Ownership Receipts

Resolve this skill's private runtime directory through Git:

```powershell
git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-path devskills/dev-issue/
```

Never hardcode a `.git` directory. These records are this publisher's
additional local write surface, not tracked files, settings, or slot
artifacts. Create the directory only when writing a verified receipt.
Do not write another publisher's receipts.

Use version-1 UTF-8 JSON with these two shapes. The numeric `1` values
for issue numbers and comment IDs below are illustrative; use the
actual positive integers returned by GitHub.

**`issue-<N>.json`** records a tool-created issue:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "kind": "issue",
  "repository": "<owner/repo>",
  "issueId": "<immutable-issue-node-id>",
  "issueNumber": 1,
  "issueUrl": "<issue-url>",
  "slotMarker": "<!-- devskills:slot=<MMDD>-<##> -->",
  "lastManaged": {
    "title": "<exact-approved-title>",
    "body": "<exact-approved-complete-body>"
  }
}
```

**`plan-<N>.json`** records its separately managed plan comment:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "kind": "plan-comment",
  "repository": "<owner/repo>",
  "issueId": "<immutable-issue-node-id>",
  "issueNumber": 1,
  "issueUrl": "<issue-url>",
  "slotMarker": "<!-- devskills:slot=<MMDD>-<##> -->",
  "commentId": 1,
  "commentUrl": "<comment-url>",
  "lastManaged": {
    "body": "<exact-approved-complete-comment-body>"
  }
}
```

**Validate the complete record.** Require every shown field and its
type, the exact version and kind, and no duplicate JSON keys. Use the
configured, cross-checked, resolving `owner/repo` for `repository`.
`issueId` is GitHub's immutable issue node ID, not its issue number;
`commentId` is the immutable numeric REST comment ID used by the API.
Verify IDs, numbers, URLs, repository, and slot against the bound issue
and fetched objects. Filename equality never proves identity. Require
the issue baseline's final line to be `slotMarker`; a comment baseline
must start with `<!-- devskills:plan -->` on its first line. The comment
receipt's `slotMarker` identifies the local slot, not ownership of the
issue body; a seeded issue need not carry that body marker.

**Compare decoded strings exactly.** Use case-sensitive, ordinal
equality for `lastManaged`, including whitespace, line endings, markers,
and the presence or absence of a final newline. Read JSON content, not
rendered CLI output. Never trim, normalize Markdown or newlines, or hash
a lossy rendering. A baseline contains only the exact approved strings
verified after this skill's successful create or update, never arbitrary
current remote content.

**Write through a temporary sibling, then replace atomically.** Serialize
the entire record as UTF-8 JSON, read it back, and validate all fields
and decoded strings before installing it. Recheck that the destination
is still the validated prior receipt, or absent for a new receipt; any
conflict stops. Never truncate a receipt in place or replace existing
evidence to make a new create fit. A failed write or atomic replacement
preserves the prior receipt and stops, without retrying the remote write.
An incomplete temporary record is not ownership evidence.

**Missing evidence means refusal, not adoption.** Missing, malformed,
unsupported-version, identity-mismatched, or conflicting receipts
authorize no overwrite. Do not delete invalid state or copy current
remote text into a new baseline. Approval cannot waive these gates.
Receipts do not travel with a clone or push; another machine or worktree,
receipt loss, or a crash before recording may make refresh unavailable.
Report the receipt path, missing or conflicting evidence, and any remote
write already made; retain every bound `#N`.

## Publishing: Create Path

Taken when **no** artifact in the slot carries a `#N`. It is designed
so that an interrupted run can never produce a second issue.

1. **Search before creating.** Look for an issue this slot may already
   own:

   ```powershell
   gh issue list --repo <owner/repo> --state all `
     --search "devskills:slot=<MMDD>-<##>" --json number,title,url
   ```

   Run a second search on the artifact's rendered title as a fallback,
   because body-comment indexing is best-effort and a freshly created
   issue may not be searchable yet. If **either** search returns a
   candidate, **show it and stop** — do not create. Offer the update
   path only if the user confirms the identity and its receipt passes
   the ownership gates below. A confirmed search match proves only a
   possible identity, not ownership or permission to overwrite.

2. **Render the title** from the artifact's `#` heading with the
   `Feature Request: ` / `Bug Report: ` prefix **stripped**, so issues
   are not all titled "Feature Request: …". The kind is carried by the
   label, not the title.

3. **Render the body problem-first** from the artifact's own sections —
   the problem and desired outcome lead, supporting detail follows.
   Append, as the **final line**, the slot marker:

   ```html
   <!-- devskills:slot=<MMDD>-<##> -->
   ```

4. **Show the exact rendered title and body, get approval, then create.**
   Freeze that approved payload; do not re-render it after approval:

   ```powershell
   gh issue create --repo <owner/repo> --title <approved-title> `
     --body-file <approved-body-file> --label <resolved-label>
   ```

5. **Write the binding immediately.** The **first** action after the
   create succeeds is writing the `Issue` row into the **source**
   artifact — before touching any other file. Only then back-fill every
   other artifact present in the slot. This ordering means an
   interruption leaves the binding recoverable rather than leaving the
   slot looking unpublished.

6. **Only then verify and record ownership.** After source binding and
   back-fill, read the created issue as JSON, including its immutable
   ID, number, URL, title, and complete body. Verify its repository and
   returned identity against the create result and binding, and compare
   title/body exactly with the frozen approved payload and slot marker.
   Only an exact match permits a new `issue-<N>.json` receipt.

   A failed or mismatched read-back, interruption, or receipt-write
   failure leaves the binding intact but grants no refresh authority.
   Stop and report it; do not retry the create or seed ownership from
   whatever text is now remote.

## Publishing: Update Path

Taken when an artifact already carries `#N`. A binding selects an issue;
it does not authorize replacing its title/body. Never create a second
issue because a refresh is refused.

1. **Validate ownership first.** Require a valid `issue-<N>.json` for
   the verified repository, bound issue number/URL, and this slot's
   marker under *Private Ownership Receipts*. The binding and marker
   corroborate identity but never grant ownership.
2. **Fetch and compare the whole baseline.**

   ```powershell
   gh issue view <N> --repo <owner/repo> --json id,number,url,title,body
   ```

   Require the immutable identity and all binding fields to match the
   receipt. Compare title and entire body exactly with `lastManaged`,
   including the slot marker. Any difference refuses the whole refresh
   before content approval can be treated as overwrite authority.
3. **Render once and approve the exact change.** Render the refined
   source using the create-path title/body rules, excluding `plan.md`.
   Show the complete before/after title/body diff against the fetched
   snapshot. Obtain in-the-moment approval of this exact payload and
   retain both the approved-before snapshot and approved-after strings.
4. **Re-fetch immediately before editing.** Revalidate identity,
   binding, repository, and receipt, and compare title/body with the
   approved-before snapshot. Any difference invalidates approval and
   stops. Never merge remote changes or re-render after approval.
5. **Send only the approved payload, then verify it.**

   ```powershell
   gh issue edit <N> --repo <owner/repo> --title <approved-title> `
     --body-file <approved-body-file>
   ```

   Read back the issue's identity and complete title/body as JSON.
   Require the returned identity and content to match the bound issue
   and approved-after strings exactly. Only then atomically replace the
   receipt's `lastManaged` baseline. A failed or uncertain write, failed
   read-back, or mismatch stops without advancing the receipt or retrying
   the edit. Never restore local content as automatic recovery.
6. **Reconcile labels separately** per the section below, with their
   own in-the-moment approvals. Never a second create.

Seeded human issues and unproven legacy issues refuse title/body refresh,
even when their current content resembles the source. A human title edit,
paragraph, footer, marker change, or whitespace difference blocks the
whole update. An unchanged, receipt-proven tool-created issue can still
be refreshed after approval. There is no click-through adoption: explain
the refusal and preserve every existing `#N`.

**These checks are optimistic, not transactional.** They detect observed
drift but cannot eliminate an edit between the final read and write.
Even an exact read-back cannot prove an intervening human edit was never
overwritten. The same limitation applies to the managed comment below;
never claim a server-side compare-and-swap guarantee.

## Labels

**This file contains no label name of its own.** The stock defaults
live only in `dev-setup`, which `AGENTS.md` exempts as the installer.
Every name used here is read from the target repository's `AGENTS.md`.

- Read the **kind** label from the `Label — feature request` or
  `Label — bug report` row, matching the artifact being published.
- Read the **docs-only** label from the `Label — docs-only (additive)`
  row.
- **Always apply the kind label.** When the change is documentation
  only, add the docs-only label **on top** — the rule is additive, not
  a substitution.

### A recorded label that no longer exists

When `gh label list --repo <owner/repo>` does not contain the recorded
name, offer exactly three options and take none of them without an
answer:

1. **Create it** — using the name from the recorded row. The name
   offered for creation comes from `AGENTS.md`, never from this skill.
2. **Map it** to an existing label the user picks from that live list.
3. **Publish unlabeled.**

Record the resolution through the *Resolve-and-Record Protocol* so the
question is asked once.

### No mapping recorded at all

The integration may have been enabled by hand, or `gh` may have been
unavailable during `dev-setup`, leaving the row as `{TBD}`. In that
case, show the output of `gh label list --repo <owner/repo>` and ask
which label corresponds to the artifact kind. **Do not guess a name**,
and **do not proceed unlabeled without asking**. Record the answer
through the Protocol.

## The Managed Plan Comment

When a finalized `plan.md` is attached to the issue, it is rendered
into **exactly one** comment whose **first line** is the marker:

```html
<!-- devskills:plan -->
```

The marker is a **tool-namespace token, not a repository-specific
value**: it identifies a candidate, not ownership, and must be byte-stable
across installs for lookup to work. It says nothing about the target
repository. The same reasoning applies to the `devskills:slot=` marker
in the create path; neither marker substitutes for a valid receipt.

An explicit plan-attachment intent may use this path without refreshing
the issue title/body, including on a seeded issue. Apply the preconditions,
binding conflict rules, and plan terminal-status gate first. A comment
receipt never grants authority over the issue title/body.

Mechanics, written out in full because `gh api` takes the repository in
the **path**, not via `--repo`:

1. **Resolve all candidates and receipt state.** Fetch the bound issue's
   immutable identity, number, and URL. Read `plan-<N>.json` if present
   and validate it under *Private Ownership Receipts*. List **all pages**
   of comments, matching the marker on the first line and correlating
   the recorded comment ID/URL with the list:

   ```powershell
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>/comments --paginate
   ```

2. **Refuse ambiguous or unproven state.** Stop on multiple marked
   candidates, an invalid or conflicting receipt, a marked comment
   without a receipt, or a recorded comment that is missing, has another
   identity/URL, or has lost or changed its first-line marker. Never
   replace it or create a duplicate to recover.
   - **Replace** only when exactly one marked comment matches the valid
     receipt and bound issue. Its complete body must exactly equal
     `lastManaged.body` before seeking approval. Human additions or any
     other difference refuse the entire replacement.
   - **Create** only when neither a marked comment nor its receipt
     exists. This is allowed on a seeded issue without an issue receipt
     and without adopting its title/body.
3. **Render once and approve separately.** Render the complete plan
   comment with the first-line marker. Show the complete before/after
   body diff for replacement, or the entire new comment for creation.
   Obtain separate in-the-moment approval for this exact payload; issue
   or label approval does not cover a comment. Retain the approved body
   and, for replacement, its approved-before snapshot.
4. **Re-fetch immediately before the write.** Revalidate the bound
   issue's identity, repository, receipt state, and all comment pages.
   Replacement requires the same sole candidate, ID/URL, first-line
   marker, and exact approved-before body. Creation requires that both
   the marked comment and receipt are still absent. Any drift
   invalidates approval and stops; never switch operations, merge, or
   re-render a fresh payload after approval.
5. **Send only the approved body.** For a proven replacement, use the
   stored comment ID. The endpoint is `/issues/comments/<id>`, **not**
   a path under `/issues/<N>/`:

   ```powershell
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/comments/<comment-id> `
     --method PATCH -F body=@<approved-body-file>
   ```

   For an approved creation with neither comment nor receipt:

   ```powershell
   gh issue comment <N> --repo <owner/repo> `
     --body-file <approved-body-file>
   ```

6. **Read back, then record.** Verify the returned comment's immutable
   ID/URL and association with the bound issue in the verified
   repository, and its entire body against the exact approved payload:

   ```powershell
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/comments/<comment-id>
   ```

   Only verified success permits creating `plan-<N>.json` or atomically
   replacing its baseline. An uncertain write, failed or mismatched
   read-back, or receipt-write failure stops with prior evidence intact.
   Never retry the write, advance the baseline, or create a duplicate
   as recovery. Report what succeeded and what remains unproven.

**Never edit or delete a comment that lacks the marker**, including a
recorded comment whose marker was removed. A marker without proven,
unchanged ownership is equally insufficient.

## Resolve-and-Record Protocol

This is the written-once behavior for every configurable value the
integration needs. **`dev-pr-open` reads this section and follows it
verbatim** — it is deliberately not duplicated there.

1. **Detect.** Read the sentinel block in `AGENTS.md` **first**. A
   recorded value — including `no`, `none`, and `n/a` — is **final**
   and ends the protocol. A resolved answer is never re-asked.
2. **Propose.** Derive a candidate from the repository itself, never
   from a preference baked into a skill:
   - For labels, the candidate set is the live
     `gh label list --repo <owner/repo>`. This skill contributes no
     name of its own.
   - For a changelog, a scan of the repository's files.

   Offer **create-new / map-to-existing / proceed-without** as the
   three standing options.
3. **Confirm.** Ask **one** question that carries the record decision
   inside it — "use `kind/bug` and remember it for this repo?" — never
   a separate second prompt to save the answer.
4. **Record.** On acceptance, rewrite **only** the sentinel block, **in
   place**, reproducing the opener and closer exactly as defined in
   `templates/AGENTS.template.md`:

   ```markdown
   <!-- >>> dev-* github integration (managed by dev-* skills) >>> -->
   <!-- <<< dev-* github integration (managed by dev-* skills) <<< -->
   ```

   Never a second copy, never appended. **Never stage, never commit.**
   Say in your report that `AGENTS.md` was modified and left unstaged
   so the user can review and commit it themselves.

## Important Rules

- **Today's date governs slot expansion.** Never reuse a previous day's
  `<MMDD>` for a numeric slot. For an earlier slot, the user must give
  a full path.
- **Source artifacts are read-only except for the `Issue` row.** That
  one row is this skill's to write; every other line of
  `featurerequest.md`, `bugreport.md`, and `plan.md` belongs to the
  skill that authored it.
- **`analysis.md` and `approach*.md` are never published.** Not as an
  issue, not as a comment, not as a quotation. Review findings re-enter
  the loop as a new `dev-request` / `dev-report`, which get their own
  issue; a solution shape reaches GitHub only through `plan.md`. The
  prohibition is on the **files** — `plan.md`'s `Approach` metadata row
  and its `## Approach` section are `dev-plan`'s own prose and **are**
  published normally as part of the plan comment.
- **No issue is ever closed here.** Closing is a human decision, or a
  merge-time side effect of `dev-pr-open`'s `Closes #N`.
- **Nothing is staged, committed, or pushed.** This skill writes local
  binding rows, sentinel-scoped configuration, and its own private
  receipts, and calls `gh`; it never touches the git index. Pushing and
  opening a PR belong to `dev-pr-open`.
- **Ownership is receipt-backed and whole-document.** Binding, markers,
  and approval cannot adopt seeded, legacy, or remotely changed content.
  Refuse rather than merge or overwrite it; preserve every bound `#N`.
- **Verify before advancing a receipt.** Keep prior evidence on any
  uncertainty or write failure, report the receipt path and outcome,
  and never retry a remote write to repair missing provenance.
- **Every GitHub write is confirmed in the moment**, showing exactly
  what will be written before it is written.
- **Never a bare `gh` write.** Use command-specific explicit targets:
  `gh repo view <owner/repo>` takes a positional repository; applicable
  `gh issue`, `gh pr`, and `gh label` commands pass
  `--repo <owner/repo>`; every `gh api` invocation carries
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>/...` in its endpoint. Take every target from the
  `Repository` row after the remote cross-check has agreed with it.
  Never retry against an implicit repository.
- **Honor repo conventions.** Repository conventions live in
  `AGENTS.md`. If it is absent, fall back to `README.md` /
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and state which source you used — but note that an
  absent `AGENTS.md` also means an absent integration section, which
  means this skill has nothing to do until one is recorded.
